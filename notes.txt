How can I get all my stuff to mount in the dev docker?
I need to mount my dotfiles dir
I need to mount all the binaries my dotfiles point to
OR
I need a way to reproduce the dependencies outside of the dev docker

SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES
  - have shell scripts that collect all the dependencies
  - for your environment to be portable, you can also use ZSH plugins
  - make sure the whole dotfiles dir is mounted
  - have a way to set up symlinks from ~/.config to the tools of choice

MY TOOLS
  - zsh
  - fzf
  - bat
  - exa
  - git
  - nvim
  - tmux
  - docker
  - bazel
  - alacritty

OUTER INSTALLATION PROCESS
  - apt install
    - tmux

INNER INSTALLATION PROCESS
  - apt install
    - zsh
    - bat
    - exa
    - fd
  - snap install
    - nvim
  - zinit install
    - fzf
  - MOUNT
    - dotfiles
    - symlinks
      - zshrc
      - alacritty
      - nvim/init.lua
